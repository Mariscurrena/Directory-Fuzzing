# Web Directory Brute Force Attacking Tool - Fuzzing

### This tool is designed for web directory fuzzing. This tool was developed to help cybersecurity specialists and penetration testers to discover hidden directories, files, and resources within a website. 

### This bash tool sends a series of requests to a target URL with various combinations of paths from a word list, this tool helps identify valid endpoints that may not be publicly visible or hidden behind access controls.

For use this tool, you can execute the following command structure:
> Command: `./directory-fuzz.sh -w <WORDLIST> -u <TARGET_URL>`

> Example: `./directory-fuzz.sh -w ./wordlist.txt -u https://www.example.com/product/`

This tool was developed for educational purposes only. Please note that fuzzing or brute-force attacks against unauthorized targets is illegal and can have several implications. I recommend using CTF environments or any other permitted resources. Some are listed below:
